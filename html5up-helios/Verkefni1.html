    We had to make a website, an online profolio for this course with html coding. I didn't know the slightest thing about coding in
    html so I decided to try to learn it from youtube. I tried to make my own website from scratch but after having half of it ready
    and finished I decided it wasn't the best page for a portfolio so I stopped working on it. I decided it was easier to go online
    and look for a site type which I could use and would be more convenient for an online portfolio.
  <br>

    <style>
      #hed3{text-align: center}
    </style>

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
        <div id="hed3"><img src="sitetype.jpg" width="400"></div>
        <br>

    
        There I found a perfect fit for my idea for a portfolio. It would come to look like this in the end.



    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="sida.jpg" width="500"></div>
    <br>
    This was a fantastic format, it had pretty much everything I wanted, from a really cool navigation bar to contact info and adjustable
    text and links. All I really had to do was upload my projects into it and make sure I knew the basics of html coding to make it work.
    Most of my time on making the website was spent on the one that was scrapped, but I really learned how to code a bit in HTML from 
    making that one. However, I didn't really know how to document the assignments into it, since I had to make a new file for them.
    After receiving some help, I got the idea of how to do them, but it wasn't as neat as the rest of the site.
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="carousel.jpg" width="700"></div>
    <br><br>
    I was a bit sad that I didn't get to really try out the features of the carousel that came with the format since I only had
    4 assignments and they all fit into it so that there was no need to "spin the carousel".
    
    Now to upload the website I was instructed to use Github. The first step was to download Git bash and to find a youtube video
    to teach you how to use it. I found quite a few of them and followed their instructions. I created an account on Github and 
    made a new repository. I uploaded all my files there and then opened the folder where all my files where. All there is to do 
    is right-click and select "Git bash here". Then I followed the instructions of the video, using commands "git init", "git status",
    "git add .", "git commit -m 'First commit' ." and "git remote add origin". 
    
    Since i was doing the code myself it was quite messy and could have looked better. 
    To upload the website I used Github. I used the domain <a href="https://www.bjorgvin98.github.io">bjorgvin98</a> on Github.

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="gitbashmynd.jpg" width="500"></div>
    
    Then you have to make a repository name, I chose bjorgvin98. Here below you can see my repository.
    <br><br>
    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="repository2.png" width="300"></div>

    Your website’s files will live in a repository named username.github.io 
    (where “username” is your actual GitHub user name). 
    <br><br>

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="repository3.png" width="700"></div>

    <style>
      p1 {
          width:40%;
          float: left;
          margin:7px;
          font-weight: bold;
          font-size: 24px;
      }
    </style>
    <div>
      <p1></p1>
      <p>Here You can see my files</p>
      <p></p1>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    To change the website you simply go into any html file you have to change. 
    Say I want to change assignmets I press that Html.

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="Html.png" width="400"></div>
    <br><br>
    Then i press this button here : 

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="takki.png" width="100"></div>
    <br><br>

    And simply type in the changes. The final step is to commit the changes. You do that
    by pressing the green button at the bottom.

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="green.png" width="900"></div>
    <br><br>

    My code is mabye not the best one as i did it mostly myself. But here you can see it. 
    
    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="meta.png" width="900"></div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="navbar.png" width="900"></div>

    <div>
      <p1></p1>
      <p>This code gives you the Nav-bar</p>
      <p></p1>
    </div>
<br><br>
    <div class="col-md-3"></div>
    <div class="img-box"></div>
    <div id="hed3"><img src="slider.png" width="900"></div>

    
    <div>
      <p2></p2>
      <p>This code here gives you the Slider on the Home-page</p>
      <p></p2>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>
    This was a time consuming and looking back at it I probably should have used a template for my website.
    I learned a lot from this project.

    <style>
      p2 {
          width:33%;
          float: left;
          margin:7px;
          font-weight: bold;
          font-size: 24px;
      }
